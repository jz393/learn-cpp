# ABOUT

I have 2 weeks left of winter break, and I'm going to learn C++. I have to use it for my upcoming summer internship so I thought I'd get a head start before the spring semester takes off. I've worked with C before, so I hope it's not too bad.

What I'm going to do:
  1) This repo: Code typical stuff (Hello World, Basic Data Structures, OO Layout) to get a feel for the syntax and keep it in      this repo.
  2) Leetcode: Convert a few problems I've already done in Python to C++. Also, complete some new problems in C++.
  3) Tensorflow: Aka what I'm going to be using C++ for during the summer. Since getting the basics down is more important,        I'll only work with it if I have time.
