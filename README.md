# About

I have 2 weeks left of winter break, and I'm going to learn C++. I have to use it for my upcoming summer internship so I thought I'd get a head start before the spring semester takes off. Pretty much I'm going to code stuff (e.g. hello world, common data structures/algorithms, baseline OOP model) and keep it here.

# Notes

About C++:
  - Statically typed, free form, need to compile, middle level language
  - Used by operating systems, system drivers, web browsers, games 
      - e.g. Photoshop, Amazon, Facebook]
  - Like an enhanced version of C

Ways to use:
  - Through Xcode on MacOS
    - Create: File > New > Project > Command Line Tool // Open With
    - Run: Product > Run // Cmd+R
  - Through text editor + command line 
     - Compile: c++ [filename].cpp
     - Execute: ./a.out


# What I've done
1. Hello World! <helloworld.cpp>
2. Vectors and String Manipulation <arrays_str.cpp>
3. Basic Gradient Descent <grad_descent.cpp>
