# About

I have 2 weeks left of winter break, and I'm going to learn C++. I have to use it for my upcoming summer internship so I thought I'd get a head start before the spring semester takes off. I've worked with C before, so I hope it's not too bad.

What I'm going to do:
  1) This repo: Take notes and code typical stuff (Hello World, Basic Data Structures, OO Layout) to get a feel for the syntax      and keep it in this repo.
  2) Leetcode: Convert a few problems I've already done in Python to C++. Also, complete some new problems in C++.
  3) Tensorflow: Aka what I'm going to be using C++ for during the summer. Since getting the basics down is more important,        I'll only work with it if I have time.   

# Notes

About C++:
  - Statically typed, free form, need to compile, middle level language
  - Used by operating systems, system drivers, web browsers, games 
      - e.g. Photoshop, Amazon, Facebook]
  - Like an enhanced version of C

Ways to use:
  - Through Xcode on MacOS
    - Create: File > New > Project > Command Line Tool // Open With]
    - Run: Product > Run // Cmd+R
  - Through text editor + command line 
     - Compile: c++ <filename>.cpp
     - Execute: ./a.out
