# About

I have 2 weeks left of winter break, and I'm going to learn C++. I have to use it for my upcoming summer internship so I thought I'd get a head start before the spring semester takes off. I've worked with C before, so I hope it's not too bad.

About C++:
  a) Statically typed, free form, need to compile, middle level language
  b) Used by operating systems, system drivers, web browsers, games
    -Like Photoshop, Amazon, Facebook
  c) Kinda like an enhanced version of C

Ways to use:
  a) Through Xcode on MacOS
    -Create: File > New > Project > Command Line Tool // Open With
    -Run: Product > Run // Cmd+R
  b) Through text editor + command line
     -Compiler: >c++ <filename>.cpp
     -Executable: >./a.out

What I'm going to do:
  1) This repo: Take notes and code typical stuff (Hello World, Basic Data Structures, OO Layout) to get a feel for the syntax      and keep it in this repo.
  2) Leetcode: Convert a few problems I've already done in Python to C++. Also, complete some new problems in C++.
  3) Tensorflow: Aka what I'm going to be using C++ for during the summer. Since getting the basics down is more important,        I'll only work with it if I have time.
